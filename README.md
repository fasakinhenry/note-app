# Note App

A place to test out appwrite's feature. The Note app is really self explanatory. Isn't it?

I don't really think this is a notes app that allows you to write notes. I know that's what you are expecting but oops sorry to disappoint you. This is more of a todo synonymous to the famous Google Notes which is one of Google's best product. You know what I mean. It is the most used app in the world. Isn't it. Why would they even have a Notes App?

> If Google can make a notes app then who am I not to.? kekw ğŸ˜†ğŸ¤£ğŸ˜‚

## Features of the Note app(or glorified todo list)

- Add Notes (sorry tasks)
- Deleted Notes
- Show as a completed Note

## Why I built the Notes App

I should be serioud now. Maybe investors would want to invest in my Notes App ğŸ˜‚. The Notes app is just a project that helpsto show how CRUD operations are done in appwrite.

## Goals of the Project

- Create a wrapper to make fetching from database easy with the help of my custom built wrapper(./appwrite/databases.js) which helps you to access database in this format.

```js
db.product.list()
```
